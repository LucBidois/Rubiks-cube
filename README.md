# Rubiks Cube

## Objective
To solidify my understanding of OOP principles I have decided to create a Rubiks Cube.

## Steps
The steps taken to complete this task are as follows:
- Use classes to create an NxNxN cube.
- Create functions to simulate rotating faces and sides.  
- Add loop to allow user input for testing. 
- Use Pygame with OpenGL to create a visual cube.
- Add a user interface for others to know how to play. 

Additional steps I may apply later:
- Click and drag functionality to move sections. 
- Algorithms to solve cube
- AI to optimise algorithms 

## Instructions
### Build
1. Clone this repository
2. `cd` into the folder
3. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages
4. Run `python Pygame_Rubiks.py`

## Developers Comments
This code is 100% my own, as such, it has taken a long time to complete. 
I would be happy to take any suggestions to improve my code by making it more readable or 
pointers to mistakes I may have made. 

Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy the code.
