# Rubiks-cube

I Decided to create a Rubiks-cube solver, so first I had to program the cube.
I decided it would be best to make it work or cubes of size n.

my Next steps are:
- Create Visuals using pygame (never used before, should be fun)
- Create some standard algorithms to be used when solving.
- Use these algorithms to solve 4x4 cube (been stuck on my physical one for weeks now)

Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy the code.
