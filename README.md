# Rubiks-cube

To solidify my understanding of OOP principles I have decided to create a Rubiks Cube.

The steps taken to complete this task are as follows:
- Use classes to create any N^3 cube.
- Create functions do simulate rotating faces and sides.  
- Add loop to allow user input for testing. 
- Use Pygame with OpenGL to create a visual Cube.
- Add a user interface for others to know how to play. 

Additional steps I may apply later:
- Click and drag functionality to move sections. 
- Algorithms to solve cube
- AI to optimise algorithms 

This code is 100% my own, as such, it has taken a long time to complete. 
I would be happy to take any suggestions to improve my code by making it more readable or pointers to mistakes I may have made. 

Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoy the code.
